This is a README file

GNU wants to have this in this place....


However you will need to install c00clupea with configure && make && make install...

Read the INSTALL file for your OS

c00clupea is not a software meant for plug & play...

This means you need some knowledge when you want to run the c00clupea honeypot

I suppose that you are able to protect your system against intruders, when you want to run c00clupea

c00clupea is a research honeypot

The source code is not really nice, (or beautified), the handling is not convenient and we have no gui....

Already here?

OK, it is your choice how to start, stop or restart c00clupea.

We are running c00clupea as a daemon in OpenBSD

You can use the command line, init.d, rc or whatever you want

"make install" just copies c00clupea to the bin-dir of your choice, copies the man page to the man-dir of your choice and the config to the config-dir of your choice.

You should be aware that some strategies need other services.
Normally these service are hardened systems or other honeypots.

However, when you don´t know what you are doing, you will have a vulnerable system...

(e.g. when you use the ssh honeypot and you redirect c00clupea to the wrong ssh-build, everyone will be able to have full root access....or when you use the uploadsystem together with the http-server you will be a web provider without any chance to control what other people will share....)....

So remember, this is a honeypot system. 
It is built for research usage, you can do a lot of fancy things with it.

But when you don´t know what you are doing, try it just inside your LAN.

Btw. c00clupea means red herring....

Btw2. c00clupea can be used as a fast web server, there is a fork of it with built-in webserver.
