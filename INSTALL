In all cases you will need to create a directory for the logfiles.

The c00clupea-user will need access to this folder.

However, c00clupea needs write access to this folder (including create a new file)

OPENBSD

./configure --mandir=/usr/local/man --sysconfdir=/etc
make
make install

MACOSX

./configure
make
make install

I suppose that you will use your Mac for development and not for production usage.

Hence this will work...
