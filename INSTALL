In all cases you will need to create a directory for the logfiles.

The c00clupea-user will need access to this folder.

However, c00clupea needs write access to this folder (including create a new file)

You will find many options with ./configure --help

Take care what you are doing....
e.g. atomic means that c00clupea is threadsafe...
to disable this feature means that the core is already threadsafe, but the stats can have threading issues...
So why? without mutexing everything c00clupea will be faster....



OPENBSD

./configure --mandir=/usr/local/man --sysconfdir=/etc
make
make install

MACOSX

./configure
make
make install

I suppose that you will use your Mac for development and not for production usage.

Hence this will work...
